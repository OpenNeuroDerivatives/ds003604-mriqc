    "Instructions": "In this game you will hear two words one after the other. I want you to answer the question 'Do the two words go together?' For example, some words go together, like 'cat, dog' or 'rose, sunflower', so you would say 'yes', because they go together. Even opposites like 'stop, go' go together because when you think about 'stop', it is easy to think about 'go', so you would say 'yes'. If the two words do not go together, like 'rabbit, spaghetti', you would say 'no' because they do not go together. Now we will try it on the computer. You will hear the two words, and you have to decide 'do the two words go together?' If the answer is 'yes', please press the button under your index finger. If the answer is 'no', press the button under your middle finger. When you hear the shhh sound, press the button under your index finger for 'yes'. You will see a blue circle appearing on the screen. When the circle changes to yellow, that is a reminder to go ahead and give your answer. If you aren’t sure, you can just take your best guess.",

    "TaskDescription": "Participants were presented through earphones with two sequentially presented one-syllable words. The task included three different experimental conditions: two related conditions in which the two words had a low (S_L) or a high semantic association (S_H) and one unrelated condition in which the two words were not related in their meaning (S_U). The three word-conditions were designed according to the following standards. The related conditions were based on the association strength values from the University of South Florida Free Association Norms (Nelson et al., 2004). The high association condition was defined as an association of 0.40-0.85 (M=0.64, SD=0.13) between the two words in the trial (e.g., SYRUP – PANCAKE). The low association condition was defined as an association of 0.14-0.39 (M=0.27, SD=0.07) between the two words in the trial (e.g., WATER – DRINK). In the unrelated condition, the two words had zero semantic association (e.g., FLUSH – CLIFF). Stimuli were matched across conditions for written word frequency, number of morphemes, and orthographic, phonological and semantic neighbors. In addition to the three experimental conditions, the task included a perceptual/motor control condition (S_C) in which participants heard two sequentially presented frequency modulated noise sounds and were asked to press ‘yes’ whenever they heard the “sh-shh” sound. Participants completed two runs of the task with 12 trials per condition per run for a total of 24 stimuli for each of the four conditions. The task included a total number of 96 trials divided into two separate 48 trials runs titled task-Sem_run-01 and task-Sem_run-02. Stimuli duration ranged between 1500 and 1865 ms and was followed by a jittered response interval between 1800 and 2701 ms. A blue circle appeared simultaneous to the auditory presentation of the stimuli, to help maintain attention in the task. The blue circle changed to yellow to provide an approximately 1000ms warning for the participants to respond, if they hadn’t already, before moving on to the next trial. Total trial duration ranged from 3300 - 4565ms. All the individual words were recorded by a single voice in a sound booth, and the duration of each word was controlled (using Praat software) to be in the range of 500 to 700ms. Responses were recorded in two windows. Window 1 consisted of the first 750ms of the trial and window 2 begins after window 1 until the end of the trial. Word pairs were combined into one stimuli file, adding a pause after the first word so that the second word began approximately 1000ms after the onset of the first word.",
