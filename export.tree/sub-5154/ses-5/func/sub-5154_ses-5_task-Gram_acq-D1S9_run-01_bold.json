    "Instructions": "In this game you will hear a woman’s voice saying a sentence. I want you to answer the question 'Does the way she speaks sound right?' For example, 'Every day, she bakes one pie.' That sounds right, so you would say 'yes'. But if the way she speaks sounds wrong, you will say 'no'. For example, 'He do not eat two vegetables.' That sounds wrong, so you would say 'no'. Now we will try it on the computer. You will hear a sentence, and you have to decide 'does the way she speaks make sense?' If the answer is 'yes', please press the button under your index finger. If the answer is 'no', press the button under your middle finger. When you hear the shhh sound, press the button under your index finger for 'yes'. You will see a blue circle appear on the screen. When the circle changes to yellow, that is a reminder to go ahead and give your answer. If you aren’t sure, you can just take your best guess.",

    "TaskDescription": "Participants were presented through earphones with one sentence at each trial. The task included three different experimental conditions: grammatically correct (G_G), plurality violation (G_P), and finiteness violation (G_F). The three sentence conditions in the syntactic task were designed according to the following standards. The finiteness violation condition was defined as the inconsistency between the subject and verb phrase by either adding an inflection or omitting an inflection/auxiliary verb (e.g., EVERY DAY, SHE PRESS ONE BUTTON). The plurality violation condition was defined as the mismatch between the number and object by either adding an “s” or omitting an “s” in the object noun word (e.g., EVERY DAY, THEY STIR THREE POT). The two conditions with grammatical violations were carefully matched in terms of the number of additions and omissions. The grammatically correct condition was defined as sentences without grammatical errors (e.g., SHE IS MOVING ONE BOX). In addition to the three experimental conditions, the task included a perceptual/motor control condition (G_C) in which participants heard frequency modulated noise and were asked to press ‘yes’ whenever they heard the “sh-shh” sound. Participants completed two runs of the task with 10 trials per condition per run for a total of 20 stimuli for each of the four conditions. The task included a total number of 80 trials divided into two separate 40 trials runs titled task-Gram_run-01 and task-Gram_run-02. Stimuli duration ranged between 2740 and 4972 ms and was followed by a 1234 – 4611 ms jittered response interval. A blue circle appeared simultaneous to the auditory presentation of the stimuli, to help maintain attention in the task. The blue circle changed to yellow to provide an approximately 1000ms warning for the participants to respond, if they hadn’t already, before moving on to the next trial. Total trial duration ranged from 5174 - 8422ms. Responses were recorded in two windows. Window 1 consisted of the first 750ms of the trial and window 2 begins after window 1 until the end of the trial.",
